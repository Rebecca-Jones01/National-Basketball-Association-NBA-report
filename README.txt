NBA Report: What factors influence success? : A study based on the NBA

Report Overview

This report was submitted in February 2021 as part of my Master's in Data Science and Analytics (Cardiff University). Template for R markdown report (lines 1-26 within the NBA_code file) provided by Evans, D and Gauthier, B. (2021, Cardiff University).

The R programming language was used to calculate the statistics and generate the visualisations.

R markdown used to generate the final pdf report. 

Contents of the report

An overview of made (successful) shots and missed (unsuccessful) shot attempts.

Do the following factors contribute to a shot being made or missed?

1. The player taking the shot.
2. The distance from the basket.
3. The amount of time taken to attempt the shot.
4. The team that the shooting player plays for.

Is there a model that can predict if a shot is successful or unsuccessful?

Conclusions

The following conclusions were made from the report:

1. The shot distance is generally greater for a missed shot and the player generally takes more time to
attempt a shot when it is not successful.

2. Different players do have an impact on the distance from the basket which the shot is attempted.

3. There is a difference between teams, with some teams being more successful than others.

4. The models fitted containing variables only relating to an individual player are not very effective in
predicting if a shot attempt is successful or not.
